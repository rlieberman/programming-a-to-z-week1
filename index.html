	<p class="text" id="p1"><span class="highlight">The green piece of paper</span> was still there on <span class="highlight">the call box</span>, partly obscuring the name Ekman. <span class="highlight">One corner of the paper</span> curled outward in <span class="highlight">the heat</span>. With her fingernail, she started to peel the tape off so that she could reposition it over the paper, but she stopped herself. The stairwell was dark. <span class="highlight">Someone on the ground floor was playing music very loudly.</span><br/><br/><a href="bttn1" id="bttn1">Change</a></p>
	<p class="text" id="p2">She got out of <span class="highlight">bed</span> and wrapped herself in <span class="highlight">her robe</span>. It was the <span class="highlight">first time</span> she could remember hating <span class="highlight">her husband.</span> Over the years that had become such a familiar, even comforting feeling. It was cold out and she crossed the courtyard as quickly as she could, taking care to avoid an icy patch. <span class="highlight">She could remember so much about that evening, but not what the problem with the younger boy had been.</span> She couldn't recall Johanna's coming home.<br/><br/><a href="bttn2" id="bttn2">Change</a></p>	
	<p class="text" id="p3">She fixed herself <span class="highlight">something to eat</span> and opened the <span class="highlight">second bottle of wine</span>. She watched <span class="highlight">the news</span> while she ate. <span class="highlight">Dusk</span> settled over the courtyard, and by eight it was dark.She turned the television off and took a thin blanket from the couch and returned to the balcony. She wrapped the blanket around her shoulders. <span class="highlight">Outside the apartment, she could smell her own inside life sharply on the blanket.</span><br/><br/><a href="bttn3" id="bttn3">Change</a></p>
	<p class="text" id="p4"><span class="highlight">The heavy front door</span> of <span class="highlight">the building</span> creaked open. <span class="highlight">The light in the hall</span> came on. It spilled out into <span class="highlight">the courtyard</span>, revealing a chair and the sharp contrasts of shadowed corners. The door slammed shut. She listened to footsteps in the stairwell. <span class="highlight">Her wineglass was empty and she got up to fill it.</span><br/><br/><a href="bttn4" id="bttn4">Change</a></p>
	<p class="text" id="p5">Louise didn't believe in <span class="highlight">fate</span>. <span class="highlight">Every morning</span> she woke up with <span class="highlight">the thought</span> that <span class="highlight">that day</span> would be the one when something terrible was destined to happen. She did this because she knew it was impossible to predict what was coming for each of us. Whatever she believed would happen that day she knew would not, owing to our inability to know the future. <span class="highlight">Lately she'd been imagining horrific things.</span><br/><br/><a href="bttn5" id="bttn5">Change</a></p>
